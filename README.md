# Portfolio of Data Science Projects
by Georgios Karakostas

---

I created this repository as a motivational tool to help me sharpen my Data Science skills. Throughout my learning journey, I’ve found that doing projects helps a lot. I eventually decided to share those projects here in hopes that others may find the content helpful. They say that the best way to learn is to teach, and I figure working on projects is close enough.

Before closing, I would like to mention the resources I’m using to build those project in respect to the authors who created the content. These are:

- Project assignments from **Kevin Markham** *Machine Learning with Text in Python* [course](https://www.dataschool.io/learn/).
- Project assignments from **Andrew Ng** Coursera *Machine Learning* [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
- Project assignments from **Andrew Ng** Coursera *Deep Learning Specialization* [course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).
- Project assignments from **DigiTyser** *Data Science Bootcamp* [workshops](https://di-academy.com/data-science-bootcamp/).
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) competitions/challenges.
