# Data Science Portfolio Blog with Personal Projects
by Georgios Karakostas

---

I created this repository as a motivational tool to help me sharpen my Data Science skills in Python. Throughout my learning journey, Iâ€™ve found that doing personal projects helps a lot. I eventually decided to share my projects here in hopes that others may find the content helpful as well. They say that the best way to learn is to teach, and I figure blogging is close enough.

Also, having a portfolio of public evidence of your data science skills can be decisive at some point. It goes without saying that, even if you have a referral, the ability to show potential employers what you can do instead of just telling them you can do something is important.
