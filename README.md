# Machine Learning Portfolio with Personal Projects
by Georgios Karakostas

---

I created this repository as a motivational tool to help me sharpen my Machine Learning skills in Python. Throughout my learning journey in Data Science, Iâ€™ve found that doing personal projects helps a lot. I eventually decided to share some of my projects here in hopes that others may find the content helpful as well. They say that the best way to learn is to teach, and I figure making personal projects is close enough.
