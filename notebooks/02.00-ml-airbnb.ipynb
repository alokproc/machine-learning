    "## Agenda\n",
    "\n",
    "One challenge that hosts looking to rent their living space face is determining the optimal nightly rent price. In many areas, renters are presented with a good selection of listings and can filter on criteria like price, number of bedrooms, room type and more. Since AirBnB is a marketplace, the amount a host can charge on a nightly basis is closely linked to the dynamics of the marketplace. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a host, if we try to charge above market price for a living space we'd like to rent, then renters will select more affordable alternatives which are similar to ours. On the other hand, ff we set our nightly rent price too low, we'll miss out on potential revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "One strategy we could use is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find a few listings that are similar to ours,\n",
    "* average the listed price for the ones most similar to ours,\n",
    "* set our listing price to this calculated average price.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of discovering patterns in existing data to make a prediction is called **machine learning**. In our case, we want to use data on local listings to predict the optimal price for us to set. In this project, we'll explore a specific machine learning technique called **k-nearest neighbors**, which mirrors the strategy we just described. Before we dive further into machine learning and k-nearest neighbors, let's get familiar with the dataset we'll be working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "While AirBnB doesn't release any data on the listings in their marketplace, a separate group named [Inside AirBnN](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25692293/inserting-a-link-to-a-webpage-in-an-ipython-notebook) has extracted data on a sample of the listings for many of the major cities on the website. In this project, we'll be working with their dataset from October 3, 2015 on the listings from Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States. Each row in the dataset is a specific listing that's available for renting on AirBnB in the Washington, D.C. area.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the dataset less cumbersome to work with, we've removed many of the columns in the original dataset and renamed the file to `dc_airbnb.csv`. Here are the columns we kept:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `host_response_rate`: the response rate of the host\n",
    "* `host_acceptance_rate`: number of requests to the host that convert to rentals\n",
    "* `host_listings_count`: number of other listings the host has\n",
    "* `latitude`: latitude dimension of the geographic coordinates\n",
    "* `longitude`: longitude part of the coordinates\n",
    "* `city`: the city the living space resides\n",

    "* `bedrooms`: number of bedrooms included in the rental\n",
    "* `bathrooms`: number of bathrooms included in the rental\n",
    "* `beds`: number of beds included in the rental\n",
    "* `price`: nightly price for the rental\n",
    "* `cleaning_fee`: additional fee used for cleaning the living space after the guest leaves\n",
    "* `security_deposit`: refundable security deposit, in case of damages\n",
    "* `minimum_nights`: minimum number of nights a guest can stay for the rental\n",
    "* `maximum_nights`: maximum number of nights a guest can stay for the rental\n",
    "* `number_of_reviews`: number of reviews that previous guests have left"
